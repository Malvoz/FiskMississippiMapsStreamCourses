# Fisk Mississippi Maps: Stream Courses

These map layers have been generated from the maps produced
by Harold Fisk for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Engineering Geology and Geophysics Branch, and were
published in 1944. The original scans, rectified for
projection, were downloaded from the website of the Corp's
[Engineering Gelology Mapping Program](http://lmvmapping.erdc.usace.army.mil/index.htm).

The images are in the public domain.

The tiles were generated with gdal2html.
